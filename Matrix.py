# In Python, a matrix is a two-dimensional data structure
# that represents a collection of elements arranged
# in rows and columns. It is commonly used for mathematical
# and scientific computations, particularly in linear algebra
# and numerical analysis.
# Matrix is very useful for machine learning and image processing.
